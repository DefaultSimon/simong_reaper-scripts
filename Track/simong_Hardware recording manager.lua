-- @about
--   A script for managing monitoring and recording MIDI and audio data from your
--   hardware devices (synths, etc.). You register a list of instruments that exist as
--   track structures; then you can easily enable or disable MIDI IN/OUT/THROUGH and AUDIO IN
--   paths for quick monitoring and recording.
